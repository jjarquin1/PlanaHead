# HTML

Added the css link from bootstrap and chose out a layout for my Time boxes. I removed unnecessary Id's and classes from the generic layout and added my own to correlate with my Css and Javascript files. 


# CSS 

Simply added background color for the user input and the Keys. 

# Javascript

Created variables that correlate to the ids for the Keys and user input value. 

Added the currentTime variable using the moment() format to display current time on page. 

Created a function to cycle through the .saveBtn class and gather values from its sibblings and parent attributes, then saved it on to local stoarage. 

Created a function to show the user input by retrieving it from Local storage by key value and returning it to an Id attached to the text input in the index.html. 

I added a console log for each response to make sure it was returning a value just for verafication.
